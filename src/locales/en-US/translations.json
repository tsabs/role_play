Some souls, however, glide forth with mysterious influence, their threads bending the weave around them, toward them, unknowingly guiding history itself wherever they walk. Events both magnificent and catastrophic tend to follow such individuals. These souls often become great rulers and terrible tyrants, powerful mages, religious leaders, and legendary heroes of lore. These are the fate-touched.\nFew fate-touched ever become aware of their prominent nature. Outside of powerful divination magics, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to confirm one as fate-touched. There are many communities that regard the status as a terrible omen, treating a confirmed fate-touched with mistrust and fear. Others seek them as a blessing, rallying around them for guidance. Some of renown and power grow jealous, wishing to bend a fate-touched beneath their will, and some stories speak of mages of old attempting to extract or transfer the essence itself.\nPlayers are not intended to select this background, but this is instead provided for the dungeon master to consider for one or more of their players, or perhaps a prominent NPC, as their campaign unfolds. It provides very minor mechanical benefit, but instead adds an element of lore, importance, and fate-bearing responsibility to a character within your story. Being fate-touched overlaps and co-exists with the character‚Äôs current background, only adding to their mystique. Consider it for a player character who would benefit from being put more central to the coming conflicts of your adventure, or for an NPC who may require protection as they come into their destiny. Perhaps consider a powerful villain discovering their fate-twisting nature and using it to wreak havoc. All of these possibilities and more can be explored should you choose to include a fate-touched within your campaign."

Choose a type of creature for your adopted parents or roll a d10 and consult the table below. Work with your GM to determine which specific creature of that type adopted you. If you are of a particular race or species that matches a result on the table, your adopted parent can't be of the same race or species as you, as this background represents an individual raised by a creature or in a culture vastly different or even alien to their birth parents.\n\n| d10 | Creature Type                                                                 |\n|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1   | Humanoid (such as gnoll, goblin, kobold, or merfolk)                          |\n| 2   | Aberration (such as aboleth, chuul, cloaker, or otyugh)                       |\n| 3   | Beast (such as ape, bear, tyrannosaurus rex, or wolf)                         |\n| 4   | Celestial or fiend (such as balor, bearded devil, couatl, deva, or unicorn)   |\n| 5   | Dragon (such as dragon turtle, pseudodragon, red dragon, or wyvern)           |\n| 6   | Elemental (such as efreeti, gargoyle, salamander, or water elemental)         |\n| 7   | Fey (such as dryad, green hag, satyr, or sprite)                              |\n| 8   | Giant (such as ettin, fire giant, ogre, or troll)                             |\n| 9   | Plant or ooze (such as awakened shrub, gray ooze, shambling mound, or treant) |\n| 10  | Monstrosity (such as behir, chimera, griffon, mimic, or minotaur)             |\n\n"

Were you the victim of a spell gone awry, or did you voluntarily sacrifice your memories in exchange for power? Is your amnesia the result of a natural accident, or did you purposefully have your mind wiped in order to forget a memory you couldn't live with? Perhaps you have family or friends that are searching for you or enemies you can't even remember."
